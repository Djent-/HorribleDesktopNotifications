# HorribleDesktopNotifications

Adds a tracker button and provides desktop notifications when shows/resolutions come out.

# Significant Problems Thus Far:
  - Took forever to get jQuery working.
  - Took forever to get background/content messaging working.
  - Adding the elements to the page in Chrome just doesn't work (use FireFox).
  - Doesn't re-add the elements after an in-page refresh.
  - Haven't even tested desktop notifications yet because shows rarely come out.
  - chrome.storage.local.set() doesn't seem to provide persistent storage. This is the biggest hurdle.
  - Chrome actually provides better error messages than FireFox, although it functions worse.
